Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Asks the user for a number as input.
2.   Uses the math module to calculate the:
o   Square root of the number
o   Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
o   Sine of the number (in radians)
3.   Displays the calculated results.

log = math.log(num)
sine_of_number = math.sin(num)
print(f"The square root: {squareRoot}")
print(f"Logarithm: {log}")
print(f"Sine: {sine_of_number}")
